-- Pokemon Ripoff 8/9/10 (lol) --

Concept: A blatant ripoff of Pokemon, complete with the four color gameboy graphics. However, the monsters aren't so quite and cuddly, but insead generic undead shit. The plot parallels the pokemon plot (albeit downsized) to comedic effect, with a young boy coming of age and proving his worth in pursuit of greed with his group of undead. Unlike pokemon, however, he is one of few who can control these beings scattered across the world.

Story: Basically get the four keys in whichever order which opens the door to some underground place with a final encounter and riches. Protagonist, although a kid, is driven by greed. The kid is able to get the help of 'sentient' versions of monsters (one of each in the world) who are more intelligent and capable of helping the kid achieve his desires. Only a select few can communicate with these monsters.

-- Gameplay --

World: The world is reminiscient of a mixture between Zelda and Gargoyle's Quest, with typical halloween esque scenery (dead trees, etc.) The world follows the flip screen (series of 160 x 144) screens like in Zelda. The four main towns are on the four corners of the map (nearly) and are connected via a couple of main routes to the hero's home town in the center. Residents of these towns are primarily human, albeit evil/wizard like and amoral at times. Generally the humans are hostile towards the monsters (some of which are humanoid-esque), except for the ones who can help you.

Encounters: For the most part, random encounters. The enemies you encounter in these situations cannot be captured and are signaled as such. 

Collecting Monsters: Every collectable monster appears on the field screen and is initiated through a touch encounter. Meeting its demands will result in it joining your ranks. Demands include certain items, defeat in combat, etc. 30ish to find in all.

Leveling Up: There are no trainers, bulk of leveling up is via random encounters and boss battles. Current monster receives experience, inactive ones receive some experience. Overleveling causes the monster to not receive experience.

Monster System: Basically, most fights are one on one, unlike Pokemon. You can call up any monster from your list at any time through the menu and he will follow you, indicating who is on your team. Monsters learn around 10 skills each.

Items: Standard inventory system.

Towns: Each of the four towns has a place to heal, item shop, generic houses, and a keymaster's dungeon. Each town is in its own corner of the world, with the starting town being in the center and having four routes that branch outward. The starting town has its own dungeon too, but it is blocked by the need for all four keys.

Dungeons: There are two or three (tbd) "transitional" dungeons to get to certain towns. Each town has a keymaster dungeon, which is basically where you face a boss who is blocking the key (a unique monster not able to be collected). There is a possibility for a couple of shorter dungeons for simple fetch quests or finding monsters.

-- Screens --

Field: The field map follows a flip screen grid based layout. The starting town is in the center of the map (along with the final dungeon), and the there are four outlying towns on either corner of the world. 

Menu: The menu has the following commands: Item, Book, Team, Save, Quit

Battles: Standard pokemon fare. Monsters have more than four abilities, but better abilities require more SP. Option to attack, defend, restore sp, and run
